Data management for the Tree of Life genome assembly pipeline

## Development Environment

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is recommended for installing Python and
managing virtual environments. After
[installing `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), install Python, *e.g.*
```sh
uv python install 3.13
```

Then all that's required to install dependencies and run commands is:

```sh
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```
